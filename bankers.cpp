// Implementation of Banker's Algorithm.

// Large portions of the code in "bankers.cpp" were created based on my own
// personal research of the Banker's Algorithm from both online and in-class
// sources. Some of the notable resources I used to help put this file together
//  include:
//     - "Bankerâ€™s Algorithm in Operating System" by GeeksForGeeks
//     - "Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance | An example." by Scholarly Things (YouTube)
//     - "<sstream>" by cplusplus.com
//     - Chapter 7 Slides from Operating Systems
//     - Any additional Article/Forum/Code references found in class or online
//
// Every resource that helped in creating this file was used purely for
// my own reference while working on Assignment 2!
